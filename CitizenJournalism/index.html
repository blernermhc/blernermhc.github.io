Many towns inMassachusetts, for instance, have no reporters covering their meetingsand events anymore. Only major catastrophes, such as murders orfloods, draw the attention of large newspapers or TVstations. Citizen-led efforts, sometimes headed by retiredjournalists, are afoot to try to fill the gap.  </p><p>If an individual or community group wants to start a news site, withno technical expertise, could they do it? And make it look like aprofessional online newspaper site? Typically not without money tohire Web designers and programmers.  Also, the sites of cash-strappednewspapers often suffer from poor design.  </p><p>A set of templates should help to reduce oreliminate the development costs associated with setting up news sites,whether staffed by professional journalists or volunteers,technology-savvy individuals or technophobes.  </p><p>This project builds on top of <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, free,open-source software designed to allow users to publish, manage andorganize content for a Web site.  It is widely used, including forcommunity Web portals and newsletters, but it requires significantcustomization work in order to get an online news site  to look and behave the way professional sites do. </p><h3>Project</h3><p>The project's goal was to make news sites easier to build, forcitizen-led groups, volunteers, schools, and other cash-strappedorganizations. Although Drupal, WordPress, and other open-sourcesystems are improving, they're still not as easy to use as they couldbe.</p><p>In particular, our goal was to design a template to be used withDrupal that would look like the front page of a newspaper.  Thetemplate was loosely based on the design of the front page of the <ahref="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> site, but with less prominent  ads. </p><p>The results of this project are available for download:</p><ul><li><a href="UserDocumentation.pdf">User documentation</a></li><li><a href="TheTimes.zip">Template files</a></li></ul></body></html>
