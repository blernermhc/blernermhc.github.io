<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Position Paper Submitted to the OOPSLA '97 Workshop
on<BR> Collaboration in the Object Development Lifecycle</H3>

<P>Software engineering is a team effort. Collaboration refers to the
ability of team members to work together to reach a common goal. 
Collaboration involves communication and sharing of ideas, plans, and
progress on an individual's activities. The exact nature of this
communication and sharing can vary greatly. For example, working out a
design on a shared whiteboard is one form of collaboration. Another form
involves one individual taking primary responsibility for an activity and
requesting help from others on particular parts of the activity, such as
when writing a paper.</P>

<P> In a software engineering environment, the artifacts that the
developers wish to collaborate on can be represented as objects. 
Collaboration can be supported by controlling access to these objects in a
way that allows the collaborators to see and modify the objects but
prohibits others from doing so. In this paper, we describe a mechanism
that supports a range of collaborative concurrency control capabilities,
providing what we believe is needed in software engineering
environments.</P>

<P> Current approaches to supporting software engineering teams provide
better support for prohibiting access to objects than for allowing access
by selected individuals. Many software engineering tools use a
checkin/checkout mechanism to control access. In these systems, there is a
public area in which objects are readable by everyone in the project. An
individual checks out an object into a private workspace, where only that
individual can see and modify it. When the changes are complete, the
individual checks the object back into the public area. To collaborate in
this type of environment typically involves working outside of the system.
For example, developers might use the operating system's access control
mechanisms to create groups of collaborators and change accessibility on
individual workspaces so that they become group workspaces. Another
approach is to allow multiple developers to checkout the same item and
require them to merge their changes when they check the objects back
in.</P>

<P> Our approach is to provide an object management infrastructure that
supports a very general model of cooperative concurrency control. The goal
is to allow individuals to decide which objects they want to work on
privately and which objects and with whom they want to collaborate. In
developing this infrastructure we focussed on four common scenarios in
software engineering:  </P>

<UL>
<P> </P>

<LI> Co-authoring - Multiple developers modify the same object. This can
be a real-time co-authorship as in a shared whiteboard environment or an
off-line co-authorship as in coding the same class. </LI>

<LI> Observation - One developer modifies an object while others can see
the progress being made, but cannot modify the object. For example, a
tester might be able to observe a design under development in order to
develop test cases. </LI>

<LI> Loaning - One developer gives an object to another to work on for a
period of time, but expects to get the object back when the second
developer is done. For example, a designer might loan a class design to
some reviewers expecting to get the design back with review comments added
to it. </LI>

<LI> Transferring - One developer gives an object to another but does not
expect to get that object back. For example, a developer may get
reassigned to a different project and therefore need to transfer
responsibility for a collection of objects to another individual. </LI>
</UL>

Individuals manipulate objects through executing programs, referred to as
<EM>clients</EM>. Individuals collaborate with each other by allowing the
respective clients that they execute to collaborate. 

<P>In our approach, collaboration is object-based. Support for cooperation
is presented through a capability-based cooperative concurrency control
mechanism. A client has to request a capability for an operation on an
object before performing the operation. A client will not be granted the
capability if the operation being requested <EM>conflicts</EM> with the
operations on the same object for which capabilities are already held by
other clients. To determine if there are conflicts, the cooperative
concurrency control mechanism maintains two data structures that are
associated with each object.</P>

<P> One data structure is a conflicting operation matrix. Two operations
on an object are defined to be <EM>conflicting</EM> if the order in which
they are executed affects the state of the object or the return value of
either operation. A conflicting operation matrix specifies whether one
operation on an object belonging to a class conflicts with another
operation on the same object.  This matrix can be used to support a simple
read/write locking scheme or a more complex semantics-based locking
scheme.</P>

<P>A client, A, cooperates with another client, B, by allowing the
cooperating client to concurrently perform conflicting operations on a
shared object.  The second data structure represents these allowed
conflicting operations on an object and is specified by clients through
the use of <EM>cooperation declarations</EM>. A cooperation declaration
made by client A, for a specific object, identifies: </P>

<UL>
<P> </P>

<LI> The client(s) with whom client A wishes to cooperate </LI>

<LI> The set of operations on the object that client A allows the
cooperating clients to perform even if they conflict with client A's
operations. </LI>

<LI> Client A's role in the collaboration, which is one of
<I>collaborator</I>, <I>loaner</I>, or <I>transferrer</I>. As a
collaborator, client A can continue to perform all operations that it has
capabilities for. As a loaner or transferrer, client A can only perform
non-conflicting operations.  A loaner expects to get the objects back when
the borrowing clients are done, whereas a transferrer does not.  </LI>

</UL>

Client B can now cooperate with client A by requesting a capability for
the operations that client A specified in its cooperation declaration. A
capability is granted to client B if:

<UL>
<P> </P>

<LI> The request is for an operation on an object that does not conflict
with any of that object's operations for which capabilities are held by
other clients.  Conflicts are determined using the conflicting operation
matrix for the class to which the object belongs. </LI>

<LI> There are cooperation declarations from the owners of the conflicting
capabilities allowing client B to perform the operation. </LI> </UL>

<P>In the absence of collaboration, this mechanism reduces to a lock-based
concurrency control mechanism, that would prevent two conflicting
operations from being performed concurrently. If the conflicting operation
matrix defines conflicts for only read and write operation, it reduces to
standard read-write locking.</P>

<P>If client A is a collaborator, client B acquires separate capabilities
for the operations specified in the cooperation declaration. In this case,
both client A and client B hold capabilities for those operations. If
client A is a loaner or a transferrer, the capabilities held by client A
for those operations are transferred to client B. If client A is a loaner,
the capabilities are transferred back to client A when client B completes
operations. If client A is a transferrer, the capabilities are released
when client B completes it operations. </P>

<P> Let's see how these primitives could be used to support the loan
example from earlier. This example is described in terms of the people to
make it easy to understand . This would, however, be implemented by making
the respective client programs perform the operations attributed to
people. Suppose Robin is designing class X and Pat is expected to review
it. For simplicity, assume the class is represented as a single object and
that standard reader/writer locking provides the default definition for
concurrency control. Also, assume that there are currently no capabilities
held on the object representing class X. In this case, Robin can acquire a
capability to create/edit class X's design since there are no conflicting
capabilities. While Robin is doing this, there can be no concurrent
readers or writers of the design since they would conflict with the
existing capability.  To give the design to Pat, Robin would make a
cooperation declaration to loan the design to Pat for writing so that Pat
could add review comments.  Now, Pat can get a write capability even
though it conflicts with Robin's write capability.  Pat does the review
and then returns the object which restores Robin's write capability. If
Robin wanted to continue modifying the design while Pat was reviewing it,
Robin would have used a co-author declaration instead of a loan
declaration.  </P>

<P> Most concurrency control mechanisms prevent concurrent access
involving conflicting operations. Our approach provides a range of
alternatives from one extreme where there is true
concurrency/collaboration to more restricted forms of collaboration such
as various forms of delegation. We would expect that one might build a
layer on top of our mechanisms that hid these primitives and provided a
more appropriate mechanism for a specific software engineering process. 
For example, the concurrency control aspects of an advanced transaction
mechanism could be built using these primitives, or a process could be
defined in which a manager specified who was responsible for various
activities with the capabilities being automatically created and delegated
as the process executes.  What we have defined here are the primitive
mechanisms that allow a wide range of cooperative concurrency control
policies to be established. </P>
