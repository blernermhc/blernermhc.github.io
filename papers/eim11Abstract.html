<h3>
Abstract
</h3>
</center>

<p>Scientists and society increasingly rely on streaming data from
  electronic sensors to assess, model, and forecast envi- ronmental
  changes. Because analyses of time-series data require uninterrupted
  data streams or datasets, scientists regularly fill gaps in the data
  by substituting modeled values. As modeling increases in complexity,
  the provenance metadata needed to describe and define processes used
  to model data and create derived datasets quickly exceeds the
  capacity of individual flags or groups of flags to annotate
  individual data values. In theory, necessary provenance metadata
  could be captured in narrative form, but the time and effort
  required to do so are prohibitive. A system that can capture
  provenance metadata automatically and allow scientists to query them
  for useful details is what scientists really need. In this paper we
  describe a system that uses Little- JIL, a process programming
  language, to rigorously define mod- eling and data-derivation
  processes, and a mathematical graph structure – a Data Derivation
  Graph (DDG) – that precisely describes execution histories. Our
  system and approach support understanding the (potentially)
  different processes used to create data values, reasoning about the
  soundness of these processes, and helping to ensure that the data
  processing in sensor net- works is reliable and reproducible.
