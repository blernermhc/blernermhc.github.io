Abstract
</h3>
</center>

<p>This paper presents a provenance-based technique to support undoing and redoing
of data analysis tasks. The technique targets scientists who experiment with
combinations of approaches to processing raw data into presentable datasets. Raw
data may be noisy and in need of cleaning, it may suffer from sensor drift that
requires retrospective calibration and data correction, or it may need
gap-filling due to sensor malfunction or environmental conditions. Different raw
datasets may have different issues requiring different kinds of adjustments, and
each issue may potentially be handled by different approaches. Thus, scientists
must often experiment with different sequences of approaches. In our work, we
show how provenance information can be used to facilitate this kind of
experimentation with scientific datasets. We describe an approach that supports
the ability to (1)~undo a set of tasks while setting aside the artifacts and
consequences of performing those tasks, (2)~replace, remove, or add a
data-processing technique, and (3)~redo automatically those set aside tasks that
are consistent with the change. We have implemented our technique and
demonstrate its utility with a case study of a common sensor-network,
data-processing scenario showing how our approach can reduce the cost of
changing intermediate data-processing techniques in a complex, data-intensive
process.
