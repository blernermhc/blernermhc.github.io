Abstract
</h3>
</center>

<p>Process modeling allows for analysis and improve- 
ment of processes that coordinate multiple people and tools 
working together to carry out a task. Process modeling typically 
focuses on the normative process, that is, how the collaboration 
transpires when everything goes as desired. Unfortunately, real 
world processes rarely proceed that smoothly. A more complete 
analysis of a process requires that the process model also include 
details about what to do when exceptional situations arise. We 
have found that in many cases, there are abstract patterns that 
capture the relationship between exception handling tasks and 
the normative process. Just as object-oriented design patterns 
facilitate the development, documentation and maintenance of 
object-oriented programs, we believe process patterns can facili- 
tate the development, documentation and maintenance of process 
models. In this paper, we focus on the exception handling patterns 
that we have observed over many years of process modeling. We 
describe these patterns using three process modeling notations: 
UML 2.0 Activity Diagrams, BPMN and Little-JIL. We present 
both the abstract structure of the pattern as well as examples of 
the pattern in use. We also provide some preliminary statistical 
survey data to support the claim that these patterns are found 
commonly in actual use and discuss the relative merits of the 
three notations with respect to their ability to represent these 
patterns.
