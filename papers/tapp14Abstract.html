Abstract
</h3>
</center>

<p>Scientific data provenance is often cited as a valuable tool for
scientists to use to document their data collection and analysis
processes, allowing improved understanding and sharing of data and
results. However, most software that supports data provenance requires
scientists to adopt new technologies rather than adding these
capabilities to technologies that scientists already use. In this
paper, we introduce RDataTracker, an R library that supports the
collection of data provenance from executed R scripts.
