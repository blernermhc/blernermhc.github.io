<H1>Evolution of Persistent Types</H1>

Persistent type
evolution is a problem specific to the modification of types used to
define persistent objects. In languages that support object
persistence directly, such as Java, the
storage representation 
used for persistent objects is derived directly from the
object's type representation. If a programmer modifies the structure
of a persistent type, that modification affects both its
representation in virtual memory and its representation in a
persistent object base. If an object is written to an object base, and
then the type representation used by that object is changed, it may no
longer be possible to read the object from the persistent object base.

My research addresses four broad problems of persistent type evolution: 
<UL>
  <LI> How can a system identify the changes a programmer makes to a
       collection of types?  
  <LI> After understanding the type changes, how can a system generate
       a transformer that will update the persistent objects to comply with
       the changed types? 
  <LI> What are the limits of automated transformer generation and how can
       the system support programmer-defined extensions to the generated
       transformer? 
  <LI> What mechanisms support transformation of persistent objects in the
       most efficient and least obtrusive manner?
