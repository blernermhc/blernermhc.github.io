<h2>Representing Provenance with a Graph</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>The data provenance that we collect is stored in a graph.  The
  nodes of the graph represent either data or 
processing steps.  Red edges connect the data to the steps that use it
as input or produce it as output.  Blue edges connect processing steps
directly to show control flow relationships.

<p>While not shown in this visualization, the graph captures additional
  information related to the scientific computation.    
Data nodes capture the scientific data, including intermediate
results produced during computation.  Nodes that represent processing
steps capture the R source code that the step represents.</p>

<p>The provenance graph snippet shown to the right was generated from
  running a simple R 
  script demonstrating some basic steps in processing sensor data for
  general use. 
  Focusing first on the yellow nodes, we see 2 steps:

<ol>
<li> Calibrate
<li> Plot data
</ol>

<p>Each yellow node represents the execution of a function.  

<p> The purple nodes represent data values that are being manipulated
  by the script.  A processing node with an arrow pointing to a data node 
  indicates that the data were output from the processing step.  For
  example, the calibrate step returns the result of doing the
  calibration.</p>

<p>Data input to functions shows how parameter bindings are done.  For
example, the calibrate function has a parameter named <i>data</i>.  In
the graph shown here, the argument passed in is <i>raw.data</i>.  The
beige node represents the binding from the argument to the parameter,
taking as input the argument and producing as output the parameter,
which is then input to the function.
</p>

<p>The green nodes represent the start and finish of a chunk of
related nodes.  In this example, they correspond to a complete
function execution, including the parameter binding and the binding of
a return value to the place where it is called.
</p>

<p>The graph representation is very general and can be used to describe
data and control flow of programs written in many languages.  In
  particular, we have written proof-of-concept tools that collected
  provenance for Python and
  for <a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu/tools/littlejil.shtml">Little-JIL</a>. 

In
  addition to the tools that we have written, others can develop tools
  that operate on these graphs.  We
  provide <a href="https://github.com/ProvTools/provParseR">provParseR</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/ProvTools/provGraphR">provGraphR</a>, R packages that
  provide an interface suitable to reading and examining provenance.
