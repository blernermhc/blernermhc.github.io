<h3>Bringing Provenance Collection to Scientists</h3>

In this project, computer scientists from Mount Holyoke College and
the University of Britsh Columbia are collaborating with environmental
scientists from Harvard Forest to explore how to capture and
productively use scientific data provenance.  
</p>

<p>
Scientists routinely collect "factual" 
data provenance such as who collected the data,
where, when, and with what instruments.  Increasingly, scientists are
using workflow tools, like <a
href="https://kepler-project.org/">Kepler</a>, 
<a href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/">Taverna</a>, and <a
href="https://www.vistrails.org/">Vistrails</a>, among 
others, to collect workflow provenance describing how data moves
between websites and a variety of tools.  However, little work has
been done collecting provenance about data analysis steps done within
tools that perform potentially complex data analyses and
transformations.  We are addressing this 
issue by collecting provenance from the execution of <a
href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, a language used widely for
statistical analysis and plotting. 
</p>

<!--<p>A wireless sensor network is currently under development for measuring
  real-time ecosystem water flux at
  the <a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Forest
  Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER)</a> site in Petersham,
  Massachusetts, USA. This system will integrate ongoing
  meteorological, hydrological, eddy flux, and tree physiological
  measurements.  Simultaneous measurements in adjoining small
  watersheds will enable researchers to study variations in water flux
  caused by differences in topography, soils, vegetation, land use,
  and natural disturbance history.  Frequent sampling will enable
  study of water flux dynamics at a wide range of temporal scales,
  from minutes to observe the response of evapotranspiration to light,
  to days to observe the response of ground water to precipitation and
  snow melt, to years to observe the response of an ecosystem to
  climate, reforestation, land use, and natural disturbance.</p>
-->

<p>
The provenance data that we collect are stored in files, along
  with copies of input and output data and plots, snapshots of
  intermediate computations and the source of the R 
  scripts that are executed.  In addition to archiving the provenance,
  we are also developing tools that use the provenance to enable a
  scientist to clean and debug their code and create a virtual machine
  that allows the exact computation to be reproduced.
