<h3>Available Software</h3>

<p>DDG Explorer is a tool that allows the user to view and query the
>Data Derivation Graphs (DDGs).  The
  DDG notation is 
general enough to support many languages, but currently we can only
  create DDGs through the execution of Little-JIL processes or
  instrumented R scripts. 

<p>DDG Explorer has the following functionality:
<ul>
<li>Visualization of DDGs, with the ability to zoom in and out to selectively show or hide details.
<li>Ability to view the data or R functions referenced by pieces of the DDG
<li>Ability to query a DDG to discover how an input data value gets used, or what data and processing steps lead to the derivation of a particular output value
<li>Ability to compare R scripts used to generate different DDGs
<li>Ability to search for where a particular data file is used or generated.
</ul>

<p>To create and work with DDGs created from R scripts, you should
  <a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu:8080/exist/xquery/data.xq?id=hf091">download
  the RDataTracker library and DDG Explorer and their user guides</a>. 
<ul>
<li>RDataTracker is an R library
  that contains functions used to instrument R scripts to collect
  provenance data in the form of
  DDGs.

<li>DDG Explorer is the tool that allows
  you to 
  visualize and query the DDGs after they have been created.  The
  software requires Java 
  1.7.
</ul>
