<h2>Representing Provenance with Data Derivation Graphs</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>The data provenance that we collect is stored in a Data Derivation
Graph (DDG).  The nodes of the graph represent either data or
processing steps.  Red edges connect the data to the steps that use it
as input or produce it as output.  Blue edges connect processing steps
directly to show control flow relationships.

<p>While not shown in this visualization, the DDG captures additional
  information related to the scientific computation.    
Data nodes capture the scientific data, including intermediate
results produced during computation.  Nodes that represent processing
steps capture the R source code that the step represents.</p>

<p>The DDG snippet shown to the right was generated from running a simple R
  script demonstrating some basic steps in processing sensor data for
  general use. 
  Focusing first on the yellow nodes, we see 2 steps:

<ol>
<li> Calibrate
<li> Plot data
</ol>

<p>Each yellow node represents the execution of a function.  

<p> The purple nodes represent data values that are being manipulated
  by the script.  A processing node with an arrow pointing to a data node 
  indicates that the data were output from the processing step.  For
  example, the calibrate step returns the result of doing the
  calibration.</p>

<p>Data input to functions shows how parameter bindings are done.  For
example, the calibrate function has a parameter named <i>data</i>.  In
the DDG shown here, the argument passed in is <i>raw.data</i>.  The
beige node represents the binding from the argument to the parameter,
taking as input the argument and producing as output the parameter,
which is then input to the function.
</p>

<p>The green nodes represent the start and finish of a chunk of
related nodes.  In this example, they correspond to a complete
function execution, including the parameter binding and the binding of
a return value to the place where it is called.
</p>

<p>The DDG representation is very general and can be used to describe
data and control flow of programs written in many languages.  We have
produced several tools to create and work with DDGs:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="RDataTracker.html">RDataTracker</a>, a tool to create DDGs from R scripts
<li> <a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu/tools/littlejil.shtml">Little-JIL</a>,
  a software process language that has DDG creation built
into it
<li> <a href="DDGExplorer.html">DDG Explorer</a>, a tool to visualize and query DDGs
<li> The <a href="ddg/index.html">DDG API</a> is also available for interested parties to create
ddgs from their own tools.
</ul>
