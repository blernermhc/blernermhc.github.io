<h4>Overview</h4>

Little-JIL is a maturing process programming language.  Processes are
written in a simple visual syntax.  While the editor enforces proper syntax,
there are a number of semantic requirements that are not guaranteed.  The
semantic checker described here checks a Little-JIL process against rules
expressed in first-order logic, and provides feedback to the programmer
identifying error conditions and providing useful warnings.  The checker
applies xlinkit, a consistency checking tool for XML documents, along with a
growing set of custom rules, to check Little-JIL processes represented in an
XML notation.  Incorporating over a dozen rules and a visual reporting tool,
the Little-JIL semantic checker provides clear and valuable information
ranging from common errors to detection of complicated data flow anomalies.

    The work available here was developed during the summer of 2002 at the
    <a href="http://www.williams.edu">Williams College</a> <a
    href="http://www.cs.williams.edu">Computer Science Department</a> by <a
    href="http://shimon.rura.org">Shimon Rura</a> under the direction of <a
    href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~blerner">Prof. Barbara
    Lerner</a>.  A <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~blerner/papers/icse03Poster.pdf">poster</a> describing this work has been accepted to
    ICSE 2003.  A <a
    href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~blerner/papers/ewspt03.pdf">paper</a>
    describing this work has been submitted to EWSPT 2003.

    <p>Features of the Little-JIL semantic checker:
    <ul>

      <li>Little-JIL <a href="ruleset.html">semantic rules</a> are encoded
      in first-order logic (using <a
      href="http://www.xlinkit.com">xlinkit</a> syntax)

      <li>the checker runs as a standalone tool that reads a Little-JIL
        process from a file and invokes xlinkit and XML tools to carry out
        semantic checking and message reporting

      <li>a graphical user-interface for the checker shows detailed
      error/warning messages and highlights relevant parts of the process
      diagram

    </ul>

    <p>An additional by-product of the development is Rule2Latex, an
    xlinkit-rule to LaTeX pretty-printer, making the first-order logic rules
    easier to read [<a href="ruleset.html">example</a>].  

    <p>Little-JIL is being developed collaboratively with researchers in the
      <a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu">LASER</a> research lab at the <a
      href="http://www.umass.edu">University of Massachusetts</a>.
