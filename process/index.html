<h1>Little-JIL Overview</h1>
</center>


A Little-JIL process is represented as a hierarchical decomposition of
steps.  The graphical representation of a Little-JIL step is shown below.<P>

<p align="center"><img src="legend-extended.jpeg"></P>

This figure shows the various badges that make up
a step, as well a step's possible connections to other steps.  The interface
badge at the top is a circle by which this step is connected to its parent.
The circle is filled if there are local definitions associated with this
step, and is empty otherwise.  The things that may be declared in an
interface are the agent who is to carry out the step, resource
requirements of the step, variable declarations, exceptions that may
be thrown, and messages that may be sent.<P>

Below the circle is the step name.  To the
left is a triangle called the pre-requisite badge.  The pre-requisite is a
step that must be successfully completed for this step to begin
execution.  If the pre-requisite is not completed successfully, an
exception is thrown and the step is not allowed to execute.
The badge appears filled if the step has a pre-requisite step, and an edge
may be shown that connects this step to its pre-requisite (not shown).  On
the right is another similarly filled triangle called the post-requisite
badge.  The postrequisite step begins execution immediately after the
step completes execution, but must also successfully complete for the parent
to be notified of the step's completion.  If the postrequisite does
not complete successfully, an exception is thrown.<P>

Within the box below the step name
are three more badges.  From left to right, they are the control flow
badge, reaction badge, and exception handler badge.  Substeps are
connected to the control flow badge.  The edge connecting a step to a
substep is annotated with parameter passing information.  The control
flow badge indicates 
the order in which the substeps may be executed.  Little-JIL defines
four control flow badges:<P>

<p align="center"><img src="control-flow.jpeg"></P>

A sequential step executes its substeps in order from left to right,
beginning the next substep only after the preceding substep completes
successfully.  A parallel step allows the substeps to be executed in
parallel.  A sequential or parallel step requires all of its
substeps to be performed.
A choice step allows the agent performing the step to
choose which single substep to execute.  A try step identifies
alternative ways of performing the step but hardwires the order in
which the alternatives should be tried from left to right.  A choice
or try step requires exactly one of its substeps to be performed 
successfully. <P>

The lightning bolt in the middle is the reaction badge to which
reaction steps are attached.  A reaction identifies a broadcast
message that it responds to.<P>

The red X is the exception
handler badge to which exception handlers are attached.  An exception
handler identifies the exception that it is handling, optionally a
step to perform to handle the exception, and a continuation badge to
indicate what to do after completion of the handler step.  There are
four continuation badges:<P>

<p align="center"><img src="continuation.jpeg"></P>

The continue badge indicates that the execution of the step should
continue.  For sequential and parallel steps, this is as if the
substep that through the exception completed successfully.  For choice
and try steps, this allows an agent to perform a different
alternative.  The retry badge indicates that the entire step should be
restarted from the beginning.  The complete badge indicates that the
entire step should be considered successful.  The rethrow badge
indicates that the entire step should be considered unsuccessful and
the exception should be thrown again.<P>

The controlflow, reaction, and exception badges are
hidden if there are no child steps, reactions, or handlers,
respectively.<P>
