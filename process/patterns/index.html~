<h4>Overview</h4>

The model checker for Little-JIL allows an analyst to check a process
for deadlock and to prove properties about a process.  This model checker
uses 
<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/">LTSA</a>,
developed at Imperial College by Jeff Kramer and Jeff 
Magee.  A process is translated to FSP, the input language for LTSA.
The analyst may extend this translation with properties to prove, also
written in FSP.

<p> There are currenlty some limitations on Little-JIL
 processes that can be translated to FSP:
<ul>
<li> Reactions are not supported.
<li> Recursion must be manually unrolled prior to translation.
<li> A parallel step may have at most 4 children.  If cardinality is
 uses with an unliminted upper bound, the analyzer will use 4 for an
 upper bound.
<li> A choice step should have no more than 5 children.
<li> The maximum number of exceptions that may arrive at one handler
 on one execution of a step is 10.
</ul>

<h4>The Project</h4>

A <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~blerner/papers/issta04.pdf">paper</a> describing this work has been accepted to
ISSTA 2004.

    <p>Little-JIL is being developed collaboratively with researchers in the
      <a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu">LASER</a> research lab at the <a
      href="http://www.umass.edu">University of Massachusetts</a>.
